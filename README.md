# ‚ú® zenflow-ai: AI-Powered Creative Storytelling Assistant (SAAS)

**zenflow-ai** is a hosted web application designed to empower creators by providing an AI-assisted platform for writing and managing stories. It helps users overcome creative blocks by generating diverse story elements (text passages, image ideas, soundscapes) based on context, allowing for a fluid and innovative writing process without requiring any local setup.

*(Add screenshots or a demo GIF here to showcase the application)*

## üöÄ Experience ZenFlow AI

Access the live application and start crafting your stories with AI assistance:

**[üëâ Visit the ZenFlow AI Application](YOUR_LIVE_DEMO_URL_HERE)**

*(Replace `YOUR_LIVE_DEMO_URL_HERE` with the actual URL where your application is hosted)*

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **AI Content Generation:** Utilize OpenAI to generate creative content for specific story elements (text passages, image descriptions, sound concepts) based on user-provided context.
*   **Element-Based Story Building:** Structure your narratives by adding different types of elements (text, image, sound) and generate content for them individually or collaboratively within the web interface.
*   **Story Management:** Create, view, update, and delete your stories securely under your user account.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login system built into the web application.
*   **Intuitive User Interface:** Clean and responsive design accessible directly through your browser.

## üíª Technology Stack

This repository contains the source code for the ZenFlow AI SAAS platform, built using the following technologies:

**Frontend (Client):**
*   React
*   Tailwind CSS
*   React Router
*   Axios
*   Vite

**Backend (API):**
*   Flask
*   Flask-SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL)
*   Flask-JWT-Extended
*   Flask-CORS
*   OpenAI Python Library
*   Python-dotenv

**Database:**
*   PostgreSQL

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

ZenFlow AI follows a standard client-server architecture:

*   The **Frontend** (Client/) is a React single-page application that provides the user interface in the browser. It communicates with the backend API.
*   The **Backend** (API/) is a Flask application that handles user authentication, story data management (CRUD operations), and the core AI interactions with the OpenAI API.
*   The **Database** (PostgreSQL) stores user and story data.

This separation allows for clear responsibilities and scalability of both the frontend and backend services, hosted independently.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository contains the source code for the ZenFlow AI SAAS:

*   `API/`: Contains the Flask backend application.
*   `Client/`: Contains the React frontend application.
*   Other configuration files (e.g., `docker-compose.yml` for deployment/development environments).
