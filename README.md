# ‚ú® zenflow-ai: AI-Powered Productivity & Life Organization (SAAS)

**ZenFlow AI** aims to be your digital oasis for calm and focused productivity. It's envisioned as an intelligent Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) platform designed to help individuals, freelancers, small teams, and creative minds cut through the digital clutter, organize their tasks, manage their time effectively, and achieve a better work-life balance using the power of Artificial Intelligence.

*(Add screenshots or a demo GIF here to showcase the application - ideally showing the current state if live, or mockups of the vision)*

## üí° The Vision: Productivity with Zen

In a world of overwhelming digital distractions, ZenFlow AI seeks to provide a simple, elegant, and intuitive space where users can focus on what truly matters. Beyond just a task list, it aspires to be a smart assistant that:

*   **Reduces Mental Overhead:** Simplifies planning and prioritization.
*   **Boosts Focus:** Provides a clean interface free from unnecessary distractions.
*   **Offers Intelligent Assistance:** Utilizes AI to provide personalized insights, suggest next steps, and automate routine organization.
*   **Promotes Balance:** Helps users understand their work patterns and make time for rest and creative flow.

This repository contains the source code that forms the foundation of this vision, including the backend API and the frontend client.

*(**Important:** Replace `YOUR_LIVE_DEMO_URL_HERE` with the actual URL where your current code is hosted. Add a note if the live version only represents a specific set of features or an earlier iteration towards the full vision).*

## ‚ú® Envisioned Key Features

ZenFlow AI is being built with the following core capabilities in mind to deliver a truly AI-powered productivity experience:

*   **Intelligent Task Management:** Effortlessly create, organize, and track tasks and projects.
*   **AI-Powered Assistance:** Get smart suggestions for task breakdown, prioritization, and time estimation based on your habits and deadlines.
*   **Personalized Insights:** AI-driven analysis of your productivity patterns to help you understand how you work best.
*   **Seamless Organization:** Simple tools to categorize, filter, and view your work in different ways.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure personal accounts to keep your data private and organized.
*   **Clean & Intuitive Interface:** A minimalist design focused on reducing distraction and enhancing focus (built with React and Tailwind CSS).
*   **Mood/Energy Integration (Future):** Connect your mental state to your tasks for smarter scheduling and recommendations.

*(Note: The features currently implemented in the code in this repository represent the foundational elements and are actively being developed towards the full vision described above.)*

## üíª Technology Stack

This project's codebase, found in this repository, is built using a modern stack:

**Frontend (Client):**
*   React: For building the dynamic user interface.
*   Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling and responsive design.
*   React Router: For navigation within the application.
*   Axios: For making API requests to the backend.
*   Vite: As a fast development build tool.

**Backend (API):**
*   Flask: A lightweight Python web framework for the API.
*   Flask-SQLAlchemy: ORM for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
*   Flask-JWT-Extended: For handling JSON Web Token based authentication.
*   Flask-CORS: To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
*   OpenAI Python Library: For integrating AI capabilities.
*   Python-dotenv: For managing environment variables.

**Database:**
*   PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database.

## üèóÔ∏è Codebase Structure Overview

This repository contains the source code split into two main parts:

*   `API/`: Houses the Flask backend application. This includes the API endpoints, database models, business logic, and initial AI integration code.
*   `Client/`: Contains the React frontend application. This is where the user interface components, pages, and client-side logic reside.

The current code provides a working foundation including user authentication, database interaction (for storing data like stories and elements in an earlier iteration), and backend-frontend communication, which are being evolved to support the productivity-focused vision.
